BracketRecalc <- function(InputFile, IsotopeMethod){
  
  #Function to recalculate d18O and d13C using the running standard for each
  #isotope method. Also calculates the hydride ratio (e.g. 16O1H/16O) and
  #relative yield.
  
  ####Args:
  #     InputFile: Dataframe with uniform column names from ColumnRename() and StandardID()
  #     IsotopeMethod: Character string refering to specific isotope method (e.g. "d18O10")
  
  #Returns:
  #     Output: Dataframe with Standard corrected isotope ratio, hydride, and yield appended
